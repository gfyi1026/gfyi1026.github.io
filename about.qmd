## At school

Hi, I'm Guy, a computer science and physics student at Pomona College who likes building tools that people actually use.

## Outside of class

I grew up in Irvine, California, and have two sisters. Here is a picture of us:

My favorite sport is soccer, and I am a member of the Pomona-Pitzer Men's soccer team here on campus. Some shots:

One of my favorite things to do in my free time is travel, whether it be to new countries or to local hiking spots in the area. Here is my most recent adventure to Albania:
